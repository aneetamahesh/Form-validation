Lab 6-Form Validation Using Regular Expression

Wrote a JavaScript to validate all fields in my domain with the following conditions
a) Name field accepting only characters and locked the digit keys
b) Phone number field having exactly 10 digits (locked the character keys) using regular expression
c) Passwords containing:
a minimum of 1 lower case letter [a-z] and
a minimum of 1 upper case letter [A-Z] and
a minimum of 1 numeric character [0-9] and
1 special character: ~`!@#$%^&*()-_+={}[]|\;:"<>,./?
at least 1 upper case, numeric and special character must be EMBEDDED somewhere in the middle of the password and not just be the first or the last character of the password string.
d) Only official mail acceptance in the field of email (E.g. username college/universityname.in).Validated the email using regular expression
